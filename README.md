It’s our continued goal to make gaming available to all players around the world, wherever you are, on the devices you want. We’re doing this by offering gamers a choice to play Xbox games by downloading to console and PC, or playing from the cloud on Windows PCs, phones, and tablets.

Today, we’re excited to announce we’re bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) to the Xbox App on Windows 10 PCs for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in 22 countries who are part of the Insider program.

Xbox Cloud Gaming with the Xbox App provides the same great Xbox experience you’re used to: Play over 100 high-quality Xbox console games with your friends; pick up from a saved game you started on your Xbox; or try out a whole new game from the Xbox Game Pass library to decide if you want to download it to your console.

With Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can turn all types of PCs into a gaming device, from brand-new budget computers to older machines with low specs. All you need to do is connect a compatible controller via Bluetooth or USB, launch the Xbox app, click the “cloud games” button, select your game and start playing. We’ve also added some new features to help you get started, including easy-to-access information on controller and network status, social features to stay connected with friends, and the ability to invite people – even those also playing on cloud without the game installed – to join you in a game.

If you’re not an Insider but interested in playing Xbox games on your PC via web browser, or accessing games on your mobile phone or tablet, please visit xbox.com/cloudgaming to learn more.

Xbox Cloud Gaming is becoming more and more important to Microsoft's games business, especially as the company continues to expand Xbox onto new devices. These days, we're seeing the team advertise pretty much any electronic devices as a potential 'Xbox', but what exactly is supported? And how do you access Xbox Cloud Gaming on your chosen device?

Well, this guide is here to break down exactly what Xbox Cloud Gaming is, how it works, and where you can play supported titles. Microsoft is continuously improving and evolving its Xbox Cloud Gaming tech, but this is where things stand as we head into 2025.

What Is Xbox Cloud Gaming?
Xbox Cloud Gaming, once known as XCloud, is Microsoft's answer to internet-based gaming. Rather than playing games natively on power-appropriate hardware, Xbox Cloud Gaming allows users to stream games over the internet without the need for a dedicated console or PC.

How Does Xbox Cloud Gaming Work?
Essentially, Xbox Cloud Gaming is the exact same as normal Xbox gaming, except Microsoft is the one doing the heavy lifting. You simply pick your supported title, hit play with Xbox Cloud Gaming, and one of Microsoft's machines will kick into gear and livestream the game right to your chosen device.
Which Games Are Supported On Xbox Cloud Gaming?
So far, Xbox Cloud Gaming has been centered around an Xbox Game Pass membership. The vast majority of titles in the Game Pass Ultimate Library support Xbox Cloud Gaming, so if you pick a title from that list, chances are it'll have a play with cloud option.

However, Xbox is now beginning to roll out Cloud Gaming support to select titles outside of the Game Pass library. In that case, you'd need to own the game to be able to play it over the cloud (and still be a Game Pass Ultimate member) - and down below is the initial list of non-Game Pass titles that are supported.

How Much Does Xbox Cloud Gaming Cost?
Xbox Cloud Gaming requires an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership to access, even if you're wanting to play cloud-supported games that you own. As we mentioned up above, Xbox's streaming service has been closely tied with Game Pass since its inception, and accessing any cloud titles needs a GPU subscription.

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate currently costs $19.99 / £14.99 per month, or your regional equivalent.

What Devices Work With Xbox Cloud Gaming?
Xbox is always adding supported devices to its Cloud Gaming list - case in point, LG Smart TV support is coming later this year.


Thanks to all who participate in the Xbox Insider Program. Your feedback will help us build a great cloud gaming experience within the Xbox app for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members!
